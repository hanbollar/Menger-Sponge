# PRESS SPACE BAR TO SEE NEXT MENGER SPONGE ITERATION

## Notes

# Slows down a lot after the third iteration. Program will stop while it loads - give it a bit and it works.
# This is because after that iteration [after pressing space bar 3 or more times] the CPU is handling over 19,000 cubes. 
# Would have done much faster inclusive/exclusive object GPU implementation but that was not the point of the recursive implementation for this assignment so didn't.
